Elements are a package of patterns which should cover very common and
frequent use-cases, so you don't have to repeat yourself again and again.

## Motivation

The goal is to cover many repeatable use-cases of writing code and make
banch of components which would solve this. You shouldn't focus on some
specifics of CSS or thinking about HTML validation or so. The goal is to
make configurable components so you can focus on your goals and business
value.
