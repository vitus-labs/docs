# Compose

A callback called `compose` is meant to be used to combine **HOC(s)**
to wrap rocketstyle component. By default, `rocketstyle` has one
default `HOC` for calculating default `attrs`. That is because
they need to be calculated based on props passed directly to component,
so you can access final calculated props even in your `HOCs`,
and access **ref** correctly. Therefore, when you attach any
own `HOC` component, it will be added between default `HOC` for `attrs`
and `rocketstyle` component itself.

HOCs can be passed as a **plain object only** under any key name you
prefer.

## An example of using compose

```tsx editor=false live=false
import RocketComponent from './ourPath'
import someHoc from './someHocPath'

const Component = RocketComponent.compose({
  myHoc: someHoc,
})
```

The plain object pattern is being used for one simple reason - having
a possibility to override it in any specific case you need.

So now, we have a `rocketstyle` component defined HOC. Now, we can
add even more HOCs and compose them together:

```tsx editor=false live=false
import anotherHoc from './anotherHocPath'

// component from previous example
const NewComponent = Component.compose({
  yetAnotherHoc: anotherHoc,
})
```

We can even remove them for some specific cases or override them:

```tsx editor=false live=false
import anotherHoc from './anotherHocPath'

// component from previous example
const NewComponent = Component.compose({
  myHoc: anotherHoc,
  yetAnotherHoc: undefined,
})
```

In the example above, only `myHoc` will be used and `yetAnotherHoc`
will be ignored.
