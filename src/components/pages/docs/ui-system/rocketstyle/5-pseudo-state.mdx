# Pseudo State

Rocketstyle has built-in support for pseudo states like `hover`,
`focus` and `pressed` and `active`. All of them can be even passed
as boolean props to rocket component and passed via context to your
children components.

This may allow you to eliminate using `CSS` selectors and overriding css
styles based on parent component current state and build independent logic
for each component separately.

## Pseudo component properties

As mentioned above, you can use `hover`, `focus`, `pressed`, and `active`
boolean props.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import RocketComponent from './ourPath'

export default () => (
  <>
    <RocketComponent hover />
    <RocketComponent focus />
    <RocketComponent pressed />
    <RocketComponent active />
  </>
)
```

This will force the component to have one of the pseudo states.
You can pass all of them, but it will have styles based on the
priorities you configure in `styles` chaining callback.

### Hover

`hover` state is triggered on `onMouseEnter` event and cancelled on `onMouseLeave`

### Focus

`focus` state is triggered on `onFocus` event and cancelled on `onBlur`

### Pressed

`pressed` state is triggered on `onMouseDown` event and cancelled on `onMouseUp`.
This is a kind of replacement for CSS `:active` selector. But when building
web applications we commonly use `active` for routing etc. there fore the different
naming.

### Active

`active` has no triggers, it can be achieved only via passing a prop. As mentioned
using `active` is a common pattern to use for `routing` and highlight `active` links
an so on.

## Pseudo via context

You can pass pseudo states via context from parent to children
component(s) via enabling `provider` and `consumer` options
in `config` callback.

When enabling `provider` it will pass not only `pseudo` but also
other dimensions states as well.

When enabling `consumer` you can specify, what states `child` component
should have based on parent states. Therefore you can simply define
the logic of how the child component should behave based on all
available states from parent component. Event it is just simply
forwarding `pseudo` states or defining that when `parent` has `hover`
child will change to `secondary` state.

This can help you defining each component states separately and
combine the logic and styles in modules independently without
overriding css rules.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import RocketComponent from './ourPath'

const Parent = RocketComponent.config({
  provider: true,
})

const ChildA = RocketComponent.config({
  consumer: (ctx) =>
    ctx(({ pseudo, state, size, variant }) => ({
      pseudo,
      state,
      size,
      variant,
    })),
})

const ChildB = RocketComponent.config({
  consumer: (ctx) =>
    ctx(({ pseudo }) => ({
      pseudo,
    })),
})

export default () => (
  <Parent>
    <ChildA />
    <ChildB />
  </Parent>
)
```

### Combining Provider and Consumer

You can even use `provider` and `consumer` at the same time in components.
When you have a component like this, it will take as a `consumer` states from
its parent, transforms `consumer` logic to its own internal state and will
pass its own states to its `children`. Therefore you can even create more
complicated a tree of components.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import RocketComponent from './ourPath'

const Parent = RocketComponent.config({
  provider: true,
})

const ChildA = RocketComponent.config({
  provider: true,
  consumer: (ctx) =>
    ctx(({ pseudo, state, size, variant }) => ({
      pseudo,
      state,
      size,
      variant,
    })),
})

const ChildB = RocketComponent.config({
  consumer: (ctx) =>
    ctx(({ pseudo }) => ({
      pseudo,
    })),
})

export default () => (
  <Parent>
    <ChildA>
      <ChildB />
    <ChildA>
  </Parent>
)
```

## Accessing props in styles

Final generated styles are passed under `$rocketstyle` prop, therefore
pseudo states and dimension states are passed under `$rocketstate` prop.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import rocketstyle from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'
import MyDefaultComponent from './somewhere'

const MyComponent = rocketstyle()()({
  component: MyDefaultComponent,
  name: '@myUiSystem/MyComponent',
}).styles(
  (css) => css`
    ${({ $rocketstyle, $rocketstate }) => css`
      /*
        $rocketstyle
          -> calcuated style properties fefined in theme
          and dimension callbacks

        $rocketstate
          -> pseudo props hover, focus, pressed, active
          -> migh help you build logic of you styles priorities
      */
    `};
  `
)
```
