# Theme

To define default theme, there is a `theme` option to do so,
or even allows you to override it later the way you need.
By default, there is a callback called `theme` where you can
configure default component theme.

For defining default `theme` there are two possible choices:

1. use plain `object`, or
2. use a `callback`.

Theme is being used as the **base** for visual identity of your
component. Which can be even extended by **dimension(s)** themes like
`states`, `sizes` etc. to separate the logic of component final
visualisation.

Theme properties depend on your styles definition. Therefore they
do not follow any strict naming policy. All theme properties are
merged into one `object` which is passed to `styled` component
under **$rocketstyle** key name.

## Theme as a plain object

You can define default `theme` by using plain object

```tsx editor=false live=false
import RocketComponent from './ourPath'

const Component = RocketComponent.theme({
  fontSize: 'something here',
  color: 'something else',
  border: false,
  someOtherPropertyValue: 'something here',
  // ...etc.
})
```

## Theme as a callback

When using the callback option, you can access `theme` passed
via `ThemeProvider`, `mode` and `css` functions to build scalable
UI. You can do so like following:

```tsx editor=false live=false
import RocketComponent from './ourPath'

const Component = RocketComponent.theme((theme, mode, css) => ({
  fontFamily: t.fontFamily.base,
  color: mode(theme.color.light, theme.color.dark),
  extendCss: css`
    font-size: ${t.fontSize.medium};
  `,
  anotherProperty: mode('white', 'black'),
  // ...etc.
}))
```
