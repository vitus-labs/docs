# Context Provider

Context Provider provides a lot of flexibility building flexible UI
design systems.

Rocketstyle Provider integrates also `ThemeProvider` from `styled-components`
out of the box.Therefore, there is no need to implement it manually. But
that's not all. Let's dive into other options provided by Rocketstyle provider.

## Usage

Default usage is following:

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { Provider } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'

const theme = {}

const App = () => <Provider theme={theme}>{/* components here */}</Provider>
```

## Dark / Light mode

Via Provider can be also defined what mode your app works in (`light` or `dark`).

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { Provider } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'

const theme = {}

// app UI works in dark mode
const App = () => (
  <Provider theme={theme} mode="dark">
    {/* components here */}
  </Provider>
)
```

## Combined Providers

Provider can be used also inside other `Providers`. This way provides
an ability to use different UI modes for different parts of the app
or to pass different themes.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { Provider } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'

const theme = {}

// whole app UI works in dark mode
const App = () => (
  <Provider theme={theme} mode="dark">
    <div>hello world</div>
    <Provider mode="light">
      {/* components here, this part of the app will be in light mode */}
    </Provider>
  </Provider>
)
```

## Inversed Mode

In the example above is described, how can be statically changed UI mode.
To have make it working dynamically without need to define
any business logic, prop `inversed` is the way to go.

This prop has an effect only if a `mode` is defined in any parent `Provider`,
otherwise is being ignored.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { Provider } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'

const theme = {}

// whole app UI works in dark mode
const App = () => (
  <Provider theme={theme} mode="dark">
    <div>hello world</div>
    <Provider inversed>
      {/* components here, this part of the app will be in light mode */}
    </Provider>
  </Provider>
)
```

## Define custom provider

Provider also accepts prop `provider` to have an ability to pass
your custom [provider](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext#provider).

By defining custom Provider, you must take into account, that you need to implement
`ThemeProvider` from `styled-components` and `VitusLabsProvider` manually, because
`VitusLabsProvider` is set as the default value of the `provider` prop.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { Provider } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'
import { Provider as VitusLabsProvider } from '@vitus-labs/core'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'
import CustomProvider from './path-to-custom-provider'

const theme = {}

// whole app UI works in dark mode
const App = () => (
  <Provider provider={CustomProvider} theme={theme} mode="dark">
    <VitusLabsProvider theme={theme}>
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{/* components here */}</ThemeProvider>
    </VitusLabsProvider>
  </Provider>
)
```
