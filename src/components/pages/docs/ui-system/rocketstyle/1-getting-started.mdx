# Getting started

Rocketstyle is **ultra powerful** and extensible **styling system** for building
React components effectively, blazingly fast, and make them easily extensible
and reusable.

## Motivation

There are several solutions and helpers but none of them have fit my
needs so far. They were not enough extensible. With Rocketstyle
you can do basically whatever you want while writing less code
and have less hassle in styles in your application.

### Advantages

One of the advantages is that you do not need to import
[React](https://reactjs.org/) or [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
in each file where you want to style your components. You can
just import a simple **rocketstyle** component and extend it as you need
in your other components. The composability is in many cases quite
unlimited and you code will be much cleaner.

Here are some of all those benefits you can feel right after you start using
Rocketstyle:

1. less imports,
2. less code,
3. less hassle,
4. huge impact in **reusability** and **consistency**.

Sounds cool, right? So, let's go through the basics and see how powerful
it can be.

## Installation

You can install it with your preferred tool (`yarn` or `npm`).

```bash live=false
# with yarn
yarn add rocketstyle

# or with npm
npm install rocketstyle --save
```

### Dependencies

Rocketstyle depends on the following packages which need to be installed as well.

| Package name      | Version |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| react             | >= 16.7 |
| styled-components | >= 5.0  |

## Getting started

Rocketstyle uses styled-components in the background and basically works
as a wrapper which will generate a **theme** object which will be passed
to a valid styled component.

When you pass any css styles it automatically wraps your component by **styled**
from [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and passes all
the styles there so it becomes a regular styled component with its own local
**theme** passed as am object prop under **$rocketstyle** key name.

## Create your first component

See the example below to see Rocketstyle in practice. The example
below uses default initialization configuration. For more advance
usage follow other chapters of this documentation.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import rocketstyle from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'
import Element from './someReactComponent'

export default rocketstyle()()({
  name: 'component/Name',
  component: Element,
})
  .theme((t) => ({
    fontFamily: 'Arial',
    lineHeight: 1.5,
    color: '#000',
  }))
  .styles(
    (css) => css`
      ${({ $rocketstyle: t }) => css`
        line-height: ${t.lineHeight};
        font-family: ${t.fontFamily};
        color: ${t.color};
      `};
    `
  )
```

## Reusability

Imagine you would like to extend the component above. Let's say,
we want to change `line-height` and `color`. We can easily do it
like several ways:

### Passing style properties in theme

We can pass `lineHeight` and `color` in theme object so the styles from
the previous example will be able to access those values.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import element from './previous-example-component'

export const NewElement = element
  .config({
    name: 'ReuseElement.name',
  })
  .theme(t => ({
    lineHeight: 3,
    color: t.white
  }))
)
```

### Extending css

We can just pass new css properties to our component.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import element from './previous-example-component'

export const NewElement = element
  .config({
    name: 'ReuseElement.name',
  })
  .styles(
    css => css`
      ${({ theme: t }) => css`
        line-height: 2;
        color: black;
      `};
    `
  )
)
```

## Responsive styling

If you want to use theming, don't forget to add **theme**
into **Provider**.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { Provider } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'

const component = () => (
  <Provider
    theme={
      {
        /* ...your theme */
      }
    }
  >
    {/* ...your components */}
  </Provider>
)
```

## Light / dark mode

Rocketstyle also has a built-in support for creating **light** / **dark** mode
styling. By default there is set **mode** to `light`. You may want to change it
by passing a mode value into **Provider**.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { Provider } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'

const component = () => (
  <Provider
    variant="light" // accepts light | dark
    theme={
      {
        /* ...your theme */
      }
    }
  >
    {/* ...your components */}
  </Provider>
)
```

### Defining styles for dark / light in components

```tsx editor=false live=false
const Component = rocketstyle()()({
  name: 'component/Name',
  component: Element,
}).theme((t, m) => ({
  fontFamily: 'Arial',
  lineHeight: 1.5,
  color: m('#000', '#fff'), // light + dark mode styles
}))
```

## Extend component

Rocketstyle uses function chaining so we can just import any rocketstyle
component and simply extend its `states`, `sizes`, `variants`, `theme`,
`styles` and so on. Below is a brief example of extending a component with
additional css properties:

```tsx editor=false live=false
import element from './previous-example-component'

export const NewElementA = element
  .config({
    name: 'ExtendElement.newName',
  })
  .styles(
    css => css`
      background-color: black;
    `
  )
)

// extend again NewElementA and create NewElement B
const NewElementB = NewElementA.styles(css => css`text-align: right;`)
```

The `NewElementA` above will look like the previous component but with
black `background-color`.

`NewElementB` will have black background color and text aligned to
the right.

For more composition patterns examples go through
the documentation so you will see the power of Rocketstyle.
