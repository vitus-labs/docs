# Initialization

Let's start with component initialization to start building UI components.

## Bootstrap your rocket component

First of all, you need to initialize `rocketstyle` and
pass a default `component` as an argument. Optionally,
you can define component `name` for better debugging.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { rocketstyle } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'
import MyDefaultComponent from './somewhere'

/*
  rocketstyle call allows you define styling dimensions
  the way you like, the example below uses default
  ones (see sections below)
*/
const MyComponent = rocketstyle()({
  component: MyDefaultComponent,
  name: '@myUiSystem/MyComponent',
})
```

Now you are ready to start building your components.

As `Rocketstyles` tries to provide as much freedom as possible,
it's definitely up to you how you configure it.

## Defining styling dimensions

Firs of all, you can set up dimensions you would like to use
for defining styles and its priorities.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { rocketstyle } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'
import MyDefaultComponent from './somewhere'

const MyComponent = rocketstyle({
  dimensions: {
    states: 'state',
    sizes: 'size',
    variants: 'variant',
    multiple: {
      propName: 'multiple',
      multi: true,
    },
  },
  useBooleans: true,
})({
  component: MyDefaultComponent,
  name: '@myUiSystem/MyComponent',
})
```

For more detailed explanation of **dimensions** configuration follow chapter
[Dimensions](/docs/ui-system/rocketstyle/dimensions).

## Defining valid CSS styles

Rocketstyle has no default `css` valid properties. Everything
is completely up to you how you would like to define and use it.

What basically **rocketstyle** does, it merges defined themes
in your component and pass them as an object under `$rocketstyle` prop
to your `styled` component. How you define the final output is completely
up to you.

For some useful best practices you can use [styles](/docs/ui-system/unistyle/styles#styles)
and/or [makeItResponsive](http://localhost:3000/docs/ui-system/unistyle/responsive#make-it-responsive)
helper from [Unistyle](/docs/ui-system/unistyle) package so you don't
have to configure everything from scratch. See the implementation on
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/vitus-labs/docs/blob/master/src/components/core/element.ts)
of this documentation website.

Below is an example of trivial configuration:

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { rocketstyle } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'
import MyDefaultComponent from './somewhere'

const MyComponent = rocketstyle()({
  component: MyDefaultComponent,
  name: '@myUiSystem/MyComponent',
}).styles(
  (css) => css`
    ${({ $rocketstyle: t, $rocketstate: s }) => css`
      text-align: ${t.textAlign};
      line-height: ${t.lineHeight};
      color: ${t.color};

      /* default browser hover event styles */
      &:hover {
        color: ${t.hover.color};
      }

      /* styles when hover prop is passed to rocket component */
      ${s.hover &&
      css`
        color: ${t.hover.color};
      `}
    `};
  `
)
```

From the configuration above we can see what kind of defined styles
can be accepted and used as `JSON` keys/values within `theme` callbacks.

```tsx editor=false live=false
// reused component from previous example
const AnotherComponent = MyComponent.theme({
  textAlign: 'center',
  lineHeight: 1.5,
  color: '#000',
  hover: {
    color: '#fff',
  },
  // other theme values will be ignored as they are not transformed
  // to valid css styles in the styles configuration above
})
```
