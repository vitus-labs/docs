# Dimensions

Dimensions help you split the logic and different needs of styles
for each component. For example splitting `state` and `size` styles
into separate logic dimensions.

For example, let's assume we have following states: `primary`, `secondary`,
`neutral`, `danger`, `warning`, `success`, and following sizes: `small`,
`medium`, and `large`.

Spliting it into different dimensions allows us to combine those styles into
final visual of our component. Therefore, we can use our component
as following:

```tsx editor=false live=false
import RocketComponent from './ourPath'

export default () => (
  <>
    <RocketComponent state="primary" size="small" />
    <RocketComponent state="secondary" size="large" />
    {/* ... */}
  </>
)
```

## What are dimensions

When defining dimensions, first thing of the cases hou you are
going to use them. The better design you pick, the more reusability
you can achieve.

### Default dimensions

By default `Rocketstyle` uses the following configuration as they
should cover the most usual cases:

```tsx editor=false live=false
const dimensions = {
  states: 'state',
  sizes: 'size',
  variants: 'variant',
  multiple: {
    propName: 'multiple',
    multi: true,
  },
} as const
```

## Configuration options

You can define as amny dimensions as you want. There are no limitations,
on the other hand having more than 3-5 dimensions can cause more hassle
or overthinking in designing UI dimension states and performance
issues as there is going to happen more calculations.

### Dimensions naming

As you can see from the default dimensions example, dimensions
are defined as an object where value can be a `string` or an `object`
containing `propName` and `multi` value.

Dimensions `keys` define how the chaining will look like, `values`
(in case they are a type of `string`) or `propName` value defines
how the dimension will be accepted as a prop in your `component`.

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { rocketstyle } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'
import MyDefaultComponent from './somewhere'

const MyComponent = rocketstyle()({
  dimensions: {
    states: 's',
    sizes: 'sz',
    variants: 'variant',
    multiple: {
      propName: 'multiple',
      multi: true,
    },
  },
  useBooleans: true,
})({
  component: MyDefaultComponent,
  name: '@myUiSystem/MyComponent',
})
// using `states` here, but `s` in prop
.states({
  primary: /* ... */,
  secondary: /* ... */,
})
.sizes({
  small: /* ... */,
  medium: /* ... */,
  large: /* ... */,
})
.multiple({
  left: /* ... */,
  top: /* ... */,
})

export default () => (
  <>
    <MyComponent s='primary' sz="small" multiple={['left', 'top']} />
  </>
)
```

### Dimensions order

First of all, the important is `order` of the dimensions.
They are combined and put together from the `first` defined
to the `last` defined dimension.

From the default dimensions, it would be following: First will
be applied `state` styles, then `size` â†’ `variant` and finally
`multiple`.

Therefore, you can define, for example, `states` and `sizes` and for
some specific cases you can override them in other dimensions like
`variant` or `multiple`.

### Single vs. multi dimensions

It's up to you if you define a `dimension` as `single` value or
`multi` value. The difference between them is that `single` value
can accept only one value as a string (or only latest boolean prop
will be picked). When using `multi`, props must be passed as an array
(or all boolean props will accepted and applied).

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { rocketstyle } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'
import MyDefaultComponent from './somewhere'

const MyComponent = rocketstyle()({
  dimensions: {
    states: 'state',
    sizes: 'size',
    variants: 'variant',
    multiple: {
      propName: 'multiple',
      multi: true,
    },
  },
  useBooleans: true,
})({
  component: MyDefaultComponent,
  name: '@myUiSystem/MyComponent',
})
.states({
  primary: /* ... */,
  secondary: /* ... */,
})
.multiple({
  left: /* ... */,
  top: /* ... */,
})

export default () => (
  <>
    <MyComponent state='primary' multiple={['left', 'top']} />

    /*
      when useBooleans is enabled,
      dimensions will be applied as follows:
      state='secondary'
      multiple={['left', 'top']}
    */
    <MyComponent primary secondary left top />
  </>
)
```

### Use booleans

Rocketstyle allows you to pick whether you prefer to use `boolean`
props or `key` props by using configuration property `useBooleans`.
By default it's set to `true`.

It is definitely up to you, what you prefer. When enabled `booleans`,
you can still use `key` props. They are still supported even as
the option for overriding all the boolean props. For example:

```tsx editor=false live=false
export default () => (
  <>
    /* booleans are ignored, result will be state="primary" */
    <MyComponent primary state="primary" secondary />
  </>
)
```

For bigger codebases may be more handy using just `key` props only.
For smaller projects could be convenient using `boolean` props as well.

## Define dimensions

For example, for basic elements like `Button`, `Link`, `Badge` etc, may be convenient
using the default dimensions. For `List` may be much mor convenient define different
dimensions, for example, `gap`, `indent`, `gapY`, `gapX` etc.

Therefore, you may define them as following:

```tsx editor=false live=false
import { rocketstyle } from '@vitus-labs/rocketstyle'
import MyDefaultComponent from './somewhere'

const MyComponent = rocketstyle()({
  dimensions: {
    gap: 'gap',
    gapX: 'gapX',
    gapY: 'gapY',
  } as const,
  useBooleans: false,
})({
  component: MyDefaultComponent,
  name: '@myUiSystem/MyComponent',
})
```

By doing so, you may specify `gap` property first and override
by `gapX` or `gapY` lately as it will be applied on top of `gap`
styling specification.

And, as you may see, it also helps you keep spacing in lists coherent
(or dimensions in general).
