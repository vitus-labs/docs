# Styles

This is a helper which helps to transform **JSON** styles into valid **CSS
properties** following the best / latest conventions and also
automatically **transforms** value **units** to the most convenient ones.

## Motivation

The goal is to cover many repeatable use-cases of writing code and make
banch of components which would solve this. You shouldn&apos;t focus on
some specifics of CSS or thinking about HTML validation or so. The goal
is to make configurable components so you can focus on your goals and
business value.

## Usage

Import the function from **@vitus-labs/unistyle** package and pass
required arguments. The function will return
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
**css** function with styles.

So, for example, let's look at an example below:

This is **cool**, isn't it? :)

## Value priorities

As there are cases, that we have an ability to define a value more ways
(**paddingLeft**, or **paddingRight** might be examples), the priorities
are following in these cases: **padding** → **paddingX** →{' '}
**padding(Left/Right)**

In general, the more specific the value is, the higher priority it has.

<ValuePriorities />

### Paddings

In case of paddings and margins can happen following example:{' '}
**padding** → **paddingY** → **paddingBottom** where output will be{' '}
**paddingBottom** value if more than one is defined. The same applies
for margins.

### Sizes

In case of sizes like width, height, minWidth, minHeight, maxWidth and
maxHeight can happen following example: **minSize** → **minWidth**
where output will be **minWidth** value if more than one is defined.
The same applies for margins.

### Border radius

You can use shorthands for border radius as well. Unfortunately, it's
pretty tricky to prioritize them clearly as they are not related to
sides but element corners. Therefore, there is also slightly different
property naming. **borderRadiusTop** → **borderRadiusLeft** →
**borderRadiusTop** where output will be **borderRadiusTop** value if
more than one is defined. The same applies for others.

As you can see from text above, higher preference have sides **left**,
**right** over **top** and **bottom**.

## Extending styles

In case you need to use a property which is not supported yet or to
overwrite some rules, you use **extendCss** property name. You can pass
it either as **string**, or **css** styled-components (recommended)
function with your styles.

<ExtendingStyles />

## Properties

These are props to which can be passed to **styles**. Most of them
follow CSS standard values. Some new properties have been added for more
comfortable development, like **margin(X/Y)** etc.
