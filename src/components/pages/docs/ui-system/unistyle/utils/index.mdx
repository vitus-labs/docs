# Utils

This section contains set of useful utility functions which may come handy
(and are being used internally in other @vitus-labs/\* packages as well).

## Breakpoints

When you import **breakpoints**, you just get a default set of defined
breakpoints as a JSON object so you can pass it to **ThemeProvider** fo
example.

<Breakpoints />

## Align content

There are differences between using **flex** align properties on web and
React Native, therefore aim of this function is to synchronize naming
and generate expected css styles.

<AlignContent />

## Extended Css

This might be usefull when you would like to use **css** from
styled-components as a param in a callback.

<ExtendCss />
