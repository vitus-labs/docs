# Getting Started

Coolgrid is an ultra-flexible and extensible grid system for **React**
based on **styled-components** and heavily inspired by Bootstrap grid system.

## Motivation

There are several solutions but most of theme require some trade offs
or are not flexible enough. With **coolgrid** you can configure it the way
you want while writing less code and have fewer DOM elements
in your application.

### What are the advantages of using coolgrid?

1. **Breakpoint keys**
   There is no strict policy about it. Feel free to define as many
   breakpoints as you like and name them the way you like. Do you prefer
   Bootstrap like naming xs, sm, md, lg, and xl? Or do you rather
   prefer more descriptive names like phone, tablet, desktop (or xsmall,
   small, medium, large, xlarge)? It's definitely up to you how you
   define them.

2. **Breakpoint values**
   For defining the size of viewports, you can use any value.
   Just a number, you can use pixels,
   percentages, whatever you like. You should just know that
   number automatically converts to em units calculated from
   rootSize defined in theme (and fallbacks to the value of 16).
   The same applies to pixels.

3. **Container width**
   Here applies the same rules as for breakpoints. There is just
   one more requirement. The keys defined for Container must have
   the same names as breakpoints.

4. **Context**
   Define behavior on Container or Row component for all
   **Col**s inside. Coolgrid uses context in the background
   so you can change the whole grid by changing just one
   line prop.

5. **A configurable number of columns**
   Bootstrap grid uses by default `12 columns`. With Coolgrid you can
   configure **columns** on **Container** for whole grid system inside
   **Container** component or you can define different count of columns
   for each **Row**. Do you need 5 or 7 column grid? No problem!

6. **Customizable gaps between columns**
   Feel free to customize the size of gaps between columns for your
   grid. Do you need large gaps between columns? Define whatever you
   need. You can define them even responsively! Do you need different
   **gutter** spacing between rows? You can customize it too!

7. **Customizable paddings inside Cols**
   The same applies here as for `gaps`. You can define inner columns
   paddings. Globaly on **Container** or **Row** component or locally
   for each **Col** separately.

8. **Customizable rendered component**
   Each ov available components accept a prop **component** which
   accepts a valid `HTML tag` or a custom `react component` and do
   much more magic. This may helps you having a valid HTML document
   with using less elements.

9. **Customizable CSS**
   Each component also have a prop for **extending** styles. So
   you can directly change how it will look like. Do you want
   to add a `background` or define `text-color`. You can do so.

## Installation

You can install it with your preferred tool (`yarn` or `npm`).

```bash
# with yarn
yarn add @vitus-labs/coolgrid

# or with npm
npm install @vitus-labs/coolgrid --save
```

## Dependencies

Coolgrid depends on the following packages which need to be installed
as well.

| Package              | Version      |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| react                | >= 16.8      |
| styled-components    | >= 5.0       |
| @vitus-labs/core     | same version |
| @vitus-labs/unistyle | same version |

Styled-components are a peer dependency of **@vitus-labs/core**.

Now, you are good to go! You can start using **Coolgrid**. If you
would like to set it up being responsive, read the following chapter.

## Responsivity

By default **coolgrid** doesn't require using **Provider** but
will not support responsivity at all. If you want to make it
responsive, don't forget to add **theme** config into **Provider**
and define breakpoints.

```tsx live=false
import { Provider, theme } from '@vitus-labs/coolgrid'

// you can import default theme settings or create new ones
// defaults are the same as Bootstrap uses
export default () => (
  <Provider
    theme={{
      ...theme,
      /* ...your theme */
    }}
  >
    {/* ...your components */}
  </Provider>
)
```

Alternatively you can make your own configuration like following:

```tsx live=false
// you can import default bootstrap theme settings or create yours.
import { Provider } from '@vitus-labs/coolgrid'

export default () => (
  <Provider
    theme={{
      // default bootstrap configuration example
      rootSize: 16, // it's being used to convert viewport px to em units
      columns: 12,
      breakpoints: {
        xs: 0,
        sm: 576,
        md: 768,
        lg: 992,
        xl: 1200,
      },
      grid: {
        container: {
          xs: '100%',
          sm: 540,
          md: 720,
          lg: 960,
          xl: 1140,
        },
      },
      /* ...your theme */
    }}
  >
    {/* ...your components */}
  </Provider>
)
```

## Code examples

Now, let's take a look at some simple examples of usage.

The following example shows how you can define each column
size separately.

```tsx live=false
import { Container, Row, Col } from '@vitus-labs/coolgrid'

// expects to use a Provider for responsive configuration
// size keys are defined in theme breakpoints
// you can define size of each column separately
export default () => (
  <Container>
    <Row>
      <Col size={3}>Column 1</Col>
      <Col size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 3 }}>Column 2</Col>
      <Col size={{ xs: 9, md: 3 }}>Column 3</Col>
      <Col size={3}>Column 4</Col>
    </Row>
  </Container>
)
```

You can define **Col** properties in **Container** or **Row**
component. It uses context in the background. It means
you can even write less code.

```tsx live=false
import { Container, Row, Col } from '@vitus-labs/coolgrid'

// size keys are defined in theme breakpoints
export default () => (
  <Container>
    <Row size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 3 }}>
      <Col>Column 1</Col>
      <Col>Column 2</Col>
      <Col>Column 3</Col>
      <Col>Column 4</Col>
    </Row>
  </Container>
)
```

It's pretty cool, right? So, check out more examples
and happy coding!
