# Text

Text is a basic component to simply render text content. By default, it
has reseted some styling.

## Examples

<Example />

## Using Text component

There are several ways of rendering text within **Text** component. So
let's take a look at them.

### Children property

First of all, you can use **Text** and pass children.

<RenderLabel />

### Label property

For shorter texts, or inline texts sometimes it's nicer to write
inline prop. If you prefer using it this way, then **label** prop
could be used. In case of passing both **children** and **label**,
then **children** will have a priority and **label** will be ignored.

<RenderLabel />

## Text types

## Paragraph

By default it renders **span** element as an **inline** text element.
If you would like to use it as a **paragraph**, you can set prop{' '}
**paragraph** to **true**, or just use property **tag='p'**.

<TypeParagraph />

## Props

These are props to which can be passed to **Text**

<Props />
