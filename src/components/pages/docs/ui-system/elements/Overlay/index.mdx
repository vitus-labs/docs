# Overlay

Overlay is a component to be used for **dropdowns**,
**popovers**, **tooltips**, or even **modal windows**
with triggers.

<Example />

## Using Overlay

There are several ways of rendering text within **Text** component. So
let's take a look at them.

### Creating a dropdown

First of all, you can use **Text** and pass children.

<UsageDropdown />

### Creating a tooltips

For shorter texts, or inline texts sometimes it's nicer to write
inline prop. If you prefer using it this way, then **label** prop
could be used. In case of passing both **children** and **label**,
then **children** will have a priority and **label** will be ignored.

## Overlay Properties

These are props to which can be passed to **Overlay**
