# List

List is a basic component to render simple lists. It could help you
avoiding repeatable patterns and using **map** function repeatedly.

Secondly, it migh help you keeping components more structured and
organized.

## Example

<Example />

## Render Items

There are several ways of rendering children within **List** component.
So let's take a look at them.

### Render children

First of all, you can use **List** as a wrapper for
your components and just pass children normally like you do in React.

<RenderChildren />

### Render from an array

Another way of rendering children is passing a props **data** and **component**
to List component and it will iterate on the background and render list
of elements.

<RenderFromArray />

## Data properties

Prop **data** must be of **Array** type, but the items within array can
be of different types.

### Array of objects

Probably the most common case is to render array of objects as a list.
This can be simply done by following example:

<DataArrayFromObjects />

### Array of strings or numbers

Sometimes you just want to render list of items which accepts only one
prop of type **string** or **number**. In that case you can just
simply pass array of values as **data** prop. It also filters **null**
and **undefined** values, therefore doesn't render empty elements
which could lead to throwing errors.

<DataArrayFromStrings />

As there is always need to add a **key** when rendering elements
dynamically, you don't have to worry about it. It will add
a [key](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) for you out
of the box.

## Item key value

By default, it will look for **key** &rarr; **id** &rarr; **itemId** in
your item object within **data** prop. In case there is no value from
those mentioned previously, it will fallback to **index** value from map
function.

Item key value can be customizable as well. You can pass **itemKey**
prop which can be either type of **string** or a **function**.

When passing a string value, **List** will use it as a key name from
item object.

<ItemKeyString />

By passing a function value you can create a customized **key** for each
element.

<ItemKeyFunction />

## Custom item component

In that case, you want to render items but some of them need to be
render using different component, you may just want to add a
**component** prop into you object data item.

<Component />

## Custom item props

You can even **data** create dynamically by using **itemProps** prop.
This prop can be either an object or a callback function which receives
item props.

When using a callback function, you get the following arguments: (
**item**: item props from data array, **extendProps**: [object](#extend-props)
of boolean values (_index_, _position_, _first_, _last_, _odd_, _even_)
and expected to return an object.

<ItemProps />

## Extend props

If you want to render a list of elements but some of the props are
static values which would be repeated within each item, then using{' '}
**extendProps** may come handy. It could be useful for example for
defining component UI state. When **extendProps** is set to **true** ,
the following boolean props will be calculated and passed to each item
component: **index**, **position** , **odd**, **even**, **first**,
**last**.

<ExtendProps />

## Wrapping items

If you would like to render a list of items but need to wrap each
element to another component, then there is no need to create a new
component where you combine them together. You can just use
**wrapComponent** prop to add a wrapping component. For example, this
might be useful when you have a list of links but want to wrap them to
**li** HTML tag to create a HTML valid list of links.

<WrapComponent />

## List properties

<Props />
