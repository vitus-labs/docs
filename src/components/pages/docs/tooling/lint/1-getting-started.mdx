# Lint your code

Lint is an opinionated preconfigured set of `eslint` and `stylelint` plugins
ready to use. The package is based on `airbnb` rules and extends them.

## Motivation

Project without `linting` is a project slowly diving to hell. Repeatable
configuration is not funny at all, therefore this is why this package exists.
This package eliminates repeating eslint configuration for each new starting
project and handles conflict rules at one place so you don't have to.

## What is packed inside

1. **ESLint basics**
   Contains the most basic JavaScript/TypeScript rules.

2. **Imports**
   Contains an [import plugin](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import)
   for import/export syntax, and prevent issues with misspelling of file paths
   and import names. Imports works with `absolute` paths as well!

3. **Typescript**
   Built in support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and even
   for using TypeScript in monorepositories. Each package can have its own
   `tsconfig.json` file with predefined paths used for `absolute imports`.
   It will work out of the box.

4. **React**
   Package has support for `React` ecosystem including `accessibility` and `hooks`.

5. **StyleLint**
   `Lint` package contains `styling` linter as well with support for `styled-components`.

6. **Prettier**
   Linting works nicely even with `prettier`.

## Installation

You can install it with your preferred tool (`yarn` or `npm`).

```bash editor=false live=false
# with yarn
yarn add @vitus-labs/tools-lint

# or with npm
npm install @vitus-labs/tools-lint --save
```

There is no need to install any other dependencies. Everything what this package needs
is installed as direct `dependencies` of this package. This makes it also comfortable
and helps prevent conflicts between packages versions.

## Dependencies

Lint depends on the following packages which doesn't have to be installed
separately at all.

| Package                               |

## Usage

### ESLint

For using `ESLint` rules, create an `.eslint.js` file in the root of your
project (a single app or monorepo) and add rules.

```jsx editor=false live=false
module.exports = require('@vitus-labs/tools-lint/eslint')
```

### Stylelint

Basically, the same approach as in case of `ESLint` applies here.
Create a file `stylelint.config.js` and import rules.

```jsx editor=false live=false
module.exports = require('@vitus-labs/tools-lint/styles')
```

Now you are ready to lint your code.

Happy linting!
