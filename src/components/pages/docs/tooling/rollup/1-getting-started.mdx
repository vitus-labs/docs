# Rollup

A predefined [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) configuration to build your libraries
without configuration hassle.

## What is packed inside

1. **Preset Env**
   Most known Babel [preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env).

2. **React**
   Preset to transpile [React](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react) components
   and `jsx`.

3. **Typescript**
   Built in TypeScript support out of the box.

## Installation

You can install it with your preferred tool (`yarn` or `npm`).

```powershell editor=false live=false
# with yarn
yarn add @vitus-labs/tools-rollup

# or with npm
npm install @vitus-labs/tools-rollup --save
```

There is no need to install any other dependencies. Everything what this package needs
is installed as direct `dependencies` of this package. This makes it also comfortable
and helps prevent conflicts between packages versions.

## Dependencies

Lint depends on the following packages which doesn't have to be installed
separately at all.

| Package                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- |
| @babel/core                               |
| @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties   |
| @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread |
| @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx         |
| @babel/preset-env                         |
| @babel/preset-react                       |
| @babel/preset-typescript                  |

## Usage

For using `Babel` configuration, create an `.babel.js` file in the root of your
library and import configuration.

```jsx editor=false live=false
module.exports = require('@vitus-labs/tools-babel/lib')
```
